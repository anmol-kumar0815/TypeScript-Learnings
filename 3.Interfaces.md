Interface: it define type structure of an object, function, and class;

For example: Interface for objects.
```
interface Person {       // Always start interface name from capital letter.
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string
}

const person: Person = {
  firstName: "Anmol",
  lastName: "Kumar"
}

interface Person {
  firstName: string;
  middleName?: string;      // Optional properties are also allowed.
  lastName: string;
}

=============================================================================================================
Interface for function

interface StringFormat {
  (str: string, flag: boolean): string  // Function will accept two argument of type string and boolean and should return a string.
}

const convertor: StringFormat = (str, flag) => {
  return flag ? str.toLowerCase() : str.toUpperCase();
}

=============================================================================================================

Interface for class.

```
interface Json {
  toJSON(): string
}

class Person implements Json {        // This interface is to ensure that the class have a method called toJSON and it must return an string.
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;

  constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string){
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  toJSON(): string {
    return JSON.stringify(Object.assign({}, this));
  }
}

const person = new Person("Anmol", "Kumar");

console.log(person.toJSON());
```
=============================================================================================================
Extend interfaces.

Suppose that you have an interface called Mailable that contains two methods called send() and queue() as follows:
```
interface Mailable {
  sendMail(email: string): boolean,
  getMail(email: string): boolean,
}
```

And you have many classes that already implemented the Mailable interface.

Now, you want to add a new method to the `Mailable` interface that sends an email later like this:
```
later(email: string, after: number): void
```
However, adding the `later()` method to the Mailable interface would break the current code.

To avoid this, you can create a new interface that extends the Mailable interface:
```
interface FutureMailable extends Mailable {
  later(email: string, after: number): boolean
}
```

```
// Complete implementation
interface Mailable {
  sendMail(email: string): boolean,
  getMail(email: string): boolean,
}

interface Later extends Mailable {
  sendLater(email: string): boolean
}

class Performer implements Mailable {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;

  constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  sendMail(email: string) {
    console.log(email);
    return true;
  }

  getMail(email: string) {
    console.log(email);
    return false;
  }
}

const p = new Performer("Anmol", "Kumar");
console.log(p.sendMail("This is dummy email"));
```

(i) An interface can extend one or multiple existing interfaces.
For example:
```
interface C {
    c(): void
}

interface D extends B, C {
    d(): void
}
```

Interfaces extending classes

(i) TypeScript allows an interface to extend a class. In this case, the interface inherits the properties and methods of the class.
Also, the interface can inherit the private and protected members of the class, not just the public members.

(ii) It means that when an interface extends a class with private or protected members, the interface can only be implemented by that class or subclasses of that class from which the interface extends.

(iii) By doing this, you restrict the usage of the interface to only classes or subclasses of the class from which the interface extends.

If you attempt to implement the interface from a class that is not a subclass of the class that the interface inherited, youâ€™ll get an error.

For example:

```
class Control {
    private state: boolean;
}

interface StatefulControl extends Control {
    enable(): void
}

class Button extends Control implements StatefulControl {
    enable() { }
}
class TextBox extends Control implements StatefulControl {
    enable() { }
}
class Label extends Control { }


// Error: cannot implement
class Chart implements StatefulControl {
    enable() { }

}
```
