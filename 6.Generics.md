TypeScript Generics

Need of generics:

Suppose you need a function that takes an array and return a random value from that array everytime.
The array can be of number, string, or object.
In this case we can't mentioned the return type of the function since if the array if of number then
the return type should be number but if thr array is of strings then return type should be string.

To overcome this problem one way is to define function return type as `any`:
```
function getRandomElement(items: any[]): any {
    let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * items.length);
    return items[randomIndex];
}
```

This solution works fine. However, it has a drawback. It doesn’t allow you to enforce the type of the returned element. In other words, it isn’t type-safe.

How to use Generics:
In these cases Generics comes to rescue us.

```
function getRandomElement<T>(items: T[]): T {
  let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * items.length);
  return items[randomIndex];
}
```

let numbers = [1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 9];
let randomEle = getRandomElement<number>(numbers);
console.log(randomEle);

This function uses type variable T. The T allows you to capture the type that is provided at the time of calling the function.
Also, the function uses the T type variable as its return type.

By convention, we use the letter T as the type variable. However, you can freely use other letters such as A, B C, ....

Generic functions with multiple types

```
function add<T, U>(rollNumber: T, studentName: U): void {
  console.log(`${studentName} rollnumber is ${rollNumber}.`);
}

add<number, string>(5, "Anmol");  // "Anmol rollnumber is 5."
```

In this example we have created two custom types as `T` and `U` we can assign any type to it.
Like in above example T is representing number type and U is representing string type.

```
add<string, string>("5", "Anmol");  // "Anmol rollnumber is 5."
```

In this case both T and U is representing string type.

================================================================================================================

The `extend` keyword in generics.

Consider the below example where merge method expects two objects and return a new merged object.

```
function merge<U, V>(obj1: U, obj2: V) {
  return { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
}

let person = merge({ name: 'John' }, { age: 25 });  // Note: It is not necessary to mention argument types when calling function like: let person = merge<object, object>({ name: 'John' }, { age: 25 });

console.log(result);  // { name: 'John', age: 25 }
```

This is fine, everything is perfect here. But consider the below call.
```
let person = merge({ name: 'John' }, 25);  //The merge() function expects two objects. However, it doesn’t prevent you from passing a non-object like this because of generic.
console.log(person);  // { name: 'John' }
```

Instead of working with all types, you may want to add a constraint to the merge() function so that it works with objects only.

To do this, you need to list out the requirement as a constraint on what U and V types can be. In order to denote the constraint, you use the extends keyword.

```
function merge<U extends object, V extends object>(obj1: U, obj2: V) {
  return { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
}
```

Because the merge() function is now constrained, it will no longer work with all types. Instead, it works with the object type only.

================================================================================================================
Using type parameters in generic constraints

The following prop() function accepts an object and a property name. It returns the value of the property.
```
function prop<T, K>(obj: T, key: K) {
  return obj[key];
}
```
But the compiler issue error: Type 'K' cannot be used to index type 'T'.

Because compiler is not sure that, K is a property in object T.

To fix this error, we can add a constraint to `K` to ensure that it is a key of `T` as follows:

function prop<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {
  return obj[key];
}

If you pass into the prop function a property name that exists on the obj, the compiler won’t complain.
For example:

let str = prop({ name: 'John' }, 'name');
console.log(str); // John

However, if you pass a key that doesn’t exist on the first argument, the compiler will issue an error:

```
let str = prop({ name: 'John' }, 'age'); // Error: Argument of type '"age"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"name"'.
```

Summery
(i) Use `extends` keyword to constrain the type parameter to a specific type.
(ii) Use `extends keyof` to constrain a type that is the property of another object.

Benefits of TypeScript generics

(i) Leverage type checks at the compile time.
(ii) Eliminate type castings.
(iii) Allow you to implement generic algorithms.
